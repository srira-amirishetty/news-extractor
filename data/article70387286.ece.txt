DATE: 2025-12-12 04:28:58

Residents of a flat complex in Palakkad, Kerala, where Rahul Mamkootathil, Palakkad’s embattled MLA facing charges of sexual abuse, has hired a flat, have demanded that he vacate it soon.
The association of the flat residents has raised the demand pointing out the inconvenience caused to them by frequent police raids.
The police had searched the flat and questioned its caretaker and other residents multiple times during the last two weeks when Mr. Mamkootathil was missing.
Two weeks after remaining untraceable, the MLA re-emerged on Thursday when he turned up to vote at a booth at Kunnathurmedu in Palakkad municipality. After casting his vote, the MLA said he would continue to be in Palakkad.
