Former Special Intelligence Branch (SIB) chief of Telangana, T. Prabhakar Rao, surrendered before Jubilee Hills police on Friday (December 12, 2025), complying with directions issued by the Supreme Court in the ongoing phone tapping investigation.
Rao, the main accused in the case, appeared before the Special Investigation Team (SIT) at the Jubilee Hills police station at 11.00 a.m., where he was questioned by the investigating officer of the case, Jubilee Hills Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) P. Venkatagiri. Officials said the interrogation has begun and the team is examining his role in the alleged surveillance operations.
The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered him to surrender immediately and cooperate with custodial interrogation. The bench instructed the SIT to ensure his safety in custody, bar any third degree methods, and allow him to receive food from home. The next hearing is listed for December 19.
Investigators expect Rao’s questioning to help establish how the alleged phone-tapping network was planned and carried out. His surrender is likely to accelerate the pace of the probe.
