Around 4.06 lakh women and girls have been trained through self-defence courses in Andhra Pradesh, said Director General of Police (DGP) Harish Kumar Gupta.
The DGP, who inaugurated the office of the Women and Child Safety Wing at Tadepalli on Thursday, directed the police to act tough on those who resort to crime against women.
He said that training in self-defence was imparted to students in 12,873 schools and 1,315 colleges in the State. The police officers were visiting educational institutions and creating awareness on crime against women and children, rights of victims, how to report and book the guilty, the DGP said.
Victims can ‘Dial 112’ or send Whatsapp messsages on 79934 85111, and the Sakthi Teams will respond immediately. Vigil has been stepped up in high risk areas, Mr. Gupta said.
“From June 2024 to November 2025, accused were convicted in 410 cases including the POCSO, sexual abuse, gang rape, kidnap, murder, dowry harassment and other cases on crime against women,” the DGP said.
Later, the DGP released brochures on women’s safety, along with Crime Investigation Department (CID) DGP Ravi Shankar Ayyanar, Additional-DGP N. Madhusudhan Reddy, IGP M. Ravi Prakash, IGP (Women Safety) B. Raja Kumari, Women Cell officers V. Ratna and N. Sridevi Rao and other officers.
