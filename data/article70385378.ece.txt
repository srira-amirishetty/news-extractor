Under the Green Tamil Nadu Mission (GTM), more than 2.24 crore Palmyrah seeds have been planted across the State, with the participation of over 16,600 volunteers. The initiative is being monitored through geo-tagging on the GTM and Udhavi mobile applications to track seed placement and field conditions.
Several districts — including Perambalur, Tiruchirappalli, Pudukkottai, Ariyalur, Tirupathur and Sivagangai — have each crossed the 10-lakh mark in seed plantations. The activity has also been carried out in Erode, Salem and Nagapattinam districts.
Officials say the Palmyrah, a culturally important and climate-resilient species in Tamil Nadu, has a lifespan of more than 120 years and supports a range of ecological functions. The tree helps stabilise riverbanks, coastal belts and drylands, contributes to groundwater recharge, and continues to sustain traditional livelihoods.
As per officials, the current effort differs from conventional forest regeneration programmes, as it does not involve raising seedlings in nurseries. Instead, Palmyrah seeds are dibbled directly into the field, allowing natural germination with minimal maintenance. Once established, the species depends largely on natural rainfall, making it suitable for semi-arid landscapes.
Supriya Sahu, Environment and Forest Secretary, said the initiative is a large-scale distribution and facilitation effort aimed at supporting and accelerating natural regeneration. The GTM’s role has been to place seeds strategically across varied landscapes and create conditions that enable their long-term survival.
Ms. Sahu said the programme contributes to Tamil Nadu’s climate adaptation goals, promotes nature-based solutions and strengthens community involvement while supporting the revival of a species closely associated with the State’s environmental heritage.
