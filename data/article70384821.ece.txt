The Andhra Pradesh Cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, on Thursday approved several major policy decisions, including enhancements to employee allowances, key reforms in prison administration, and major investments in water and maritime infrastructure, and approval of the proposals cleared by the State Investment Promotion Board (SIPB) and Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA).
Addressing the media at the Secretariat, Information and Public Relations Minister Kolusu Parthasarathi outlined the Cabinet’s resolutions, describing them as crucial steps toward administrative modernisation and economic revival.
A significant decision was the approval to enhance Dearness Allowance (DA) and Dearness Relief (DR) by 3.64 per cent for State government employees and pensioners. The revised rates will be applicable retrospectively from January and July 2023.
The Minister said the decision reflects the government’s commitment to supporting its workforce amid rising inflationary pressures.
The Cabinet also approved the reconstitution of the Andhra Pradesh State Social Welfare Board to strengthen the utilisation and monitoring of welfare funds, ensuring that welfare schemes are implemented more effectively across the State.
In a major move for water resource development, the Cabinet ratified the State Water Action Plan, which had earlier been cleared by the Apex Committee. The plan covers 506 projects with a revised administrative sanction of ₹9,514.63 crore.
Additionally, the government approved lump-sum procurement and execution modalities for 281 works aimed at improving irrigation efficiency and scientific water management.
The Cabinet cleared the draft of the “Andhra Pradesh Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2025,” intended to replace the outdated central laws of 1894 with a modern correctional framework. The Bill will be placed before the Legislative Assembly.
In the maritime sector, the Cabinet approved the allocation of 29.58 acres of land at Juvvaladinne Fishing Harbour in Nellore district to Sagar Defence Engineering Pvt. Ltd. for the establishment of an Autonomous Maritime Shipyard and Systems Centre. The land will be transferred from the Fisheries Department to the Andhra Pradesh Maritime Board.
Further, the government approved ₹1,596.50 crore for the repair and modernisation of four major tank systems under the Minor Irrigation Department, benefiting farmers across Punganur and Chinnagottigallu mandals and enhancing irrigation potential over 892 acres, he added.
