Ruling National Conference (NC) legislator Tanvir Sadiq on Thursday (December 11, 2025) claimed the presence of carcinogenic nitrofuran and nitroimidazole residues in eggs in the market and urged the J&K Government to launch a probe into it.
“Deeply concerned by reports of Nitrofuran and Nitroimidazole residues being detected in eggs, drugs that are strictly banned in food-producing animals because of their carcinogenic and toxic effects,” Mr. Sadiq said, in a post on X.
He said the issue becomes even more serious because eggs were consumed heavily by children, senior citizens, and patients. “Doctors often prescribe eggs as a primary source of protein, making this a direct public-health risk,” Mr. Sadiq said.

The NC MLA urged J&K Health Minister and the Minister for Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs “to immediately order market-wide sampling, laboratory residue testing, source tracing and strict punitive action if violations are confirmed”.
“The safety of the public cannot be compromised under any circumstances and that the matter must be handled with urgency,” Mr. Sadiq said.
