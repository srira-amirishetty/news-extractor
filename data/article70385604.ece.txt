TITLE: Kerala actor rape case: Court to pronounce sentence today
DATE: 2025-12-11 18:37:58

The Ernakulam Principal Sessions Court will pronounce the quantum of punishment for the convicts in the 2017 actor rape case on Friday.
The court will hear the arguments of the counsels of the convicts and the prosecution during the forenoon session. The punishment awarded to each of the convicts on the charges found against them would be decided after considering the attending and mitigating circumstances in the case.
The mitigating circumstances are factors that reduce the culpability or the severity of a crime, which could be used for canvassing a lighter sentence for the convict. The age of the convict, the mental state in which the crime was committed and even the absence of any criminal antecedents of the convicts could be considered as the mitigating factors, legal sources pointed out.
The attendant circumstances include the elements of the crime, including the severity of the act and its larger implications. The court weighs these factors to decide on the quantum of the punishment, sources said,
Incidentally, the court had convicted the first six accused in the case, including N.S. Sunil, aka Pulsur Suni and acquitted three others, including actor Dileep, the eighth accused.
