Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday questioned the Maharashtra government on the financial ‘package’ announced by the Chief Minister for the flood-affected people of the State. He alleged that the State government “hurriedly” sent a proposal last week after Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that his Ministry has not received any proposal from Maharashtra for providing assistance to farmers.
Speaking to reporters at the party office in Vidhan Bhavan premises in Nagpur, where the State legislature is having its Winter Session, Mr. Thackeray said, “We want to ask what proposal has the State government sent to the Centre, how much relief amount it has demanded and who will benefit from it. Details of the proposal should be tabled in the legislature.”
As the Winter Session started, the debate around the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) began. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) criticised the Mahayuti-led government for not appointing the LoP, whereas the ruling party highlighted that a party requires at least 10% of the total Assembly seats, which no Opposition party holds.
Mr. Thackeray reiterated, “If there is room for Deputy Chief Minister positions, then why is the government scared of appointing an LoP.”
