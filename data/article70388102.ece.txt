Ms. Murthy opened her speech by congratulating Anganwadi workers who are contributing to the country, particularly in rural areas.
The Rajya Sabha MP noted that the anganwadi scheme has completed 50 years. “In 1975, the Integrated Child Development Scheme was introduced to look after pregnant women, lactating mothers and children aged 0 to 6, acting as a type of ECCE and continued in a buffer zone taking care of malnutrition,” Ms. Murty highlights.
She noted that a big change took place under the Vajpayee government in 2002, where the 86th Constitutional amendment introduced a fundamental right to free and compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14.
She noted that a directive principle of state policy was also introduced for ECCE. Ms. Murty called education a magic wand which changes the lives of those it touches, and added that it improves the society and contributes to the economy.
