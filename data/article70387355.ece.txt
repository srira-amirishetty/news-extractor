Union Home Minister Amit Shah asserted in the Lok Sabha that the Centre would ‘detect, delete and deport’ every illegal immigrant from India. Replying to Leader of Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi’s accusations of vote theft, Mr. Shah accused him of trying to spread falsehoods through his claims of “vote chori (theft)”, adding that “some families” were “generational vote chors (thieves)”. He also accused Opposition parties of objecting to the SIR because they want to keep “infiltrators” in the electoral rolls.
