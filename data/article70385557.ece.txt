The Bengaluru police have launched a preliminary inquiry after multiple carcasses of what suspected to be dogs and cats were discovered in an open area in Banaswadi, East Bengaluru.
A city-based animal rights NGO filed a complaint with the police stating that several carcasses had been found in a vacant plot in Subbaiahnapalya, expressing concern that the animals might have been killed for black magic rituals.
A police officer told The Hindu that the complaint has been acknowledged and the site inspected. However, no FIR has been filed yet, as the police have decided to conduct a preliminary investigation first.
According to the officer, the location where the carcasses were found was commonly used for dumping waste. They suspect that someone may have discovered the carcasses elsewhere and disposed of them at that spot. The police would review CCTV footage from the area before deciding whether to file an FIR or close the complaint.
