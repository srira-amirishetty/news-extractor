DATE: 2025-12-12 05:08:09

The DGCA removed four flight inspection officers in connection with the crackdown following the massive flight disruptions at IndiGo.
While the immediate reason for the decision was not known, several questions are being asked of DGCA and what it did to assess IndiGo’s pilot requirement before allowing the airline 10% more flights in the winter schedule as well as its preparedness to comply with the new pilot duty and rest norms.
