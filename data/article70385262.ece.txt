The ‘All India Save Education Committee (AISEC)’ has passed the resolution against the ‘KPS-Magnet School’ scheme in its ‘Jana Samavesha (Public Convention)’ which was held at Gandhi Bhavan on Thursday.
Several education experts, former Vice-Chancellors, writers, activists, parents/guardians, and students from across the State urged for withdrawal of the ‘KPS-Magnet School’ scheme which is detrimental to 40,000 government schools and closure of government schools.
S.G. Siddaramaiah, writer, criticised that the government’s policy of privatising education has led to it becoming expensive and discriminatory. He urged the government to abandon the scheme, which he said was a blow to the education of children from marginalised communities, women, farmers, and laborers.
L.N. Mukundaraj, president of the Karnataka Sahitya Academy, spoke about how education was attained through the struggle and sacrifice of many great individuals. He said it was the responsibility of everyone to save and strengthen this public education system.
