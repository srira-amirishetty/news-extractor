The over 3,500-page charge sheet, along with the evidence, were brought to the court in four trunks, officials said.
The lawyers said North East India Festival chief organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta and three others were charged with murder in the SIT charge sheet.
Zubeen Garg’s cousin and suspended police officer Sandipan Garg was charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder in SIT charge sheet
The nine-member SIT arrived in a convoy of six vehicles.
The celebrated singer died under mysterious circumstances in Singapore on September 19 while swimming in the sea. He had gone to that country to attend the 4th edition of the North East India Festival (NEIF).
The Assam government had constituted the SIT, led by Special DGP M P Gupta, to investigate into the singer’s death.
Mr. Gupta had earlier said that seven arrests have been made so far in connection with the case, including the chief organiser of the festival, Shyamkanu Mahanta, and over 300 witnesses examined.
Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had claimed in the recently concluded assembly session that Garg’s death was ‘’plain and simple murder’’.
The Singapore Police Force (SPF), carrying out an independent investigation into Garg’s death, had said in a statement that preliminary probe has not indicated any foul play, and that the investigations may take up to another three months.
