TITLE: Sabarimala gold theft case: Vigilance court denies former TDB president A. Padmakumar bail
DATE: 2025-12-12 09:29:55

The Vigilance Court in Kollam on Friday dismissed a bail application submitted by former Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) president A. Padmakumar, who is under arrest for his alleged role in the Sabarimala gold misappropriation case.
The court accepted the prosecution’s argument that there was sufficient evidence to prove the CPI(M) leader’s role in the suspected gold theft. The prosecution also submitted that granting bail as the probe is under way could jeopardise its progress, and may also enable him to destroy evidence or influence witnesses in the case.
Mr. Padmakumar contended that the decision to hand over the gold-clad copper plates covering the door frames to the Sreekovil at the Sannidhanam to Unnikrishnan Potti, the prime accused, was a collective one adopted by the TDB. He also accused the special investigation team probing the case of targeting him alone, while sparing others who were active members in the decision. Besides, he sought bail on other grounds, including age-related ailments.
However, the court rejected such arguments to deny him relief.
