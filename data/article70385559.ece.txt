TITLE: Lure of better life turns tribal youth into drug mules
DATE: 2025-12-12 04:38:04

Sagar (name changed), a 21-year-old from G. Madugula, completed his degree last year with high hopes for a better future. While preparing for competitive examinations and helping his parents, he regularly attended the job melas organised by the Andhra Pradesh Skill Development Centre in association with the Police department.
Though focused on academics, he also enjoyed spending time with friends, one of whom was Charan (name changed). Everyone in the village knew that Charan had once been involved in a ganja case, but no one fully understood the seriousness or long-term consequences of such an offence. Sagar, too, never thought much about it, valuing his friendship over the rumours surrounding Charan.
Over time, however, Charan began taking Sagar to various places, spending money lavishly and gradually introducing him to certain habits. Sagar found himself enjoying the comfort and lifestyle that Charan offered — a lifestyle he and his family could not afford.
A few weeks ago, Charan asked Sagar to accompany him to deliver a parcel assigned by his boss. Sagar, without questioning much, simply followed. On their way back, the duo was intercepted by a police team. During the inspection of their bags, the police found hash oil — a liquid form of ganja, and both were immediately arrested. Sagar tried to explain that he had no knowledge of the smuggling, but being caught with the contraband left him with no escape from arrest or the case under the strict Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.
For Sagar’s parents, the news was devastating. They had placed immense hope and trust on their son. “He gives a lot of importance to studies, and we were confident that he would make something of his life. Whenever he stepped out, if we asked where he was going, he never gave clear answers. Bad company destroyed my child’s future,” says his father, Raja Rao.
The case is currently under investigation, and his family fears that the NDPS case registered against him may become a major setback in his career.
Around 30 km away from G. Madugula, the life of 27-year-old Ramesh from Chintapalli region took a turn for the worse earlier this year. After completing his Intermediate, he was eking out a living doing odd jobs and was unable to properly support his family. One day, he was offered work as a “pilot” to help transport ganja from one point to another, a distance of nearly 20 km in the Agency. He was promised Rs 10,000 for the job.
“In his confession, Ramesh said he had travelled across the area many times. Since he had debts and needed money for his family, he agreed. He, however, never imagined he would be caught. He regrets taking part in this activity,” says the police officer who apprehended him, on condition of anonymity.
Across the Agency region, several youth — some knowingly, others unknowingly — are entering ganja smuggling for the money it offered, unaware of the harsh punishment under the NDPS Act. Once arrested, they face long jail time, and although bail is possible after several months, repeated court visits and the stigma of an NDPS case severely damage their career prospects and take a toll on their mental health.
“Ganja mafia groups, mostly outsiders, lure local youth with money and expensive items. In several cases, tribal youth admitted that they agreed to take part in the activity for getting a mobile phone or cash ranging from ₹5,000 to ₹25,000, depending on the quantity and distance they were asked to transport or assist as a ‘pilot’.
“Tragically, many confessed they only wanted to help their parents, buy medicines, manage household expenses or clear debts. These reasons sadden us too. Despite our frequent awareness campaigns, they assume they can escape if they spot the police. But with extensive technological networks to trace backward and forward linkages, they eventually get caught,” a senior police officer explained, seeking anonymity.
According to legal experts, once arrested under NDPS cases, the accused are remanded in judicial custody, and bail is extremely difficult to obtain for up to six months. “There is no way that the court grants bail within 180 days. The conditions are stringent; the judge must believe that the accused did not commit the offence and also believe that they will not commit such an offence in the future,” says senior advocate and president of the Forum for Legal Professionals Kuppili Muralidhar.
He adds that there are very limited chances of bail when the quantity of ganja is less than 20 kg, but most cases registered in the region involve larger quantities, he notes, adding that convictions under the NDPS Act may lead to 10 years’ imprisonment and, in severe cases, up to life imprisonment.
A senior police officer with experience handling NDPS cases says that although the court allows 180 days for investigation and filing of the charge sheet, completing an NDPS investigation within this period is extremely challenging. “So, we file a petition requesting an additional 180 days, citing the extensive linkages involved. The court usually grants the extension,” he says, on condition of anonymity.
Deputy Superintendent of Police, Visakhapatnam Central Jail, Ch Surya Kumar says the jail houses 1717 inmates, 1026 of whom are NDPS prisoners — producers, suppliers or consumers. Around 400 of these inmates are from the tribal regions of ASR district or parts of Odisha, he notes.
Madhavi, a psychologist working with the Jail Department, says that youth involved in such offences often experience a mix of anxiety, regret and denial. “Some individuals, who are closely connected to their families and chose this activity owing to financial constraints, suffer intense anxiety and deep regret. But there are others who feel they have not made any major mistake,” she explains.
Citing an example, she adds: “One inmate was just 20 years old, and his wife was five months pregnant. He regretted his decision immensely, yet even his own kin did not come forward to help him secure bail.” On the other hand, she says, youth who lack proper parental supervision and are attracted by easy money and a lavish lifestyle often justify their actions, claiming they have not done anything seriously wrong. “They question why they should work an entire month to earn ₹20,000 when they believe they can make ₹10,000 in an hour.”
“In the first week of imprisonment, many young inmates develop thoughts of ending their lives — not because they were caught smuggling, but because they cannot cope with the jail environment,” she points out. Madhavi stresses the importance of parental guidance to keep the youth out of the talons of crime. “There must be proper monitoring right from childhood — understanding what activities they are engaged in, how much time they spend outside and how they are using the money given to them. Early guidance can prevent them from falling into such traps,” she emphasises.
What tribal leaders say
Tribal leaders from ASR district accuse the government of neglecting local youth and failing to address longstanding issues, which, they say, has contributed to the rise of such incidents. “Poverty and a lack of employment opportunities are the primary reasons pushing tribal youth towards these activities. The ganja mafia, mostly comprising people from outside the State, target the youth luring them with money and promises of a luxurious lifestyle,” says Killo Surendra, a member of the Andhra Pradesh Girijana Sangham.
“The governments have consistently failed to resolve concerns linked to G.O. no. 3, which is meant to ensure local jobs for local people. Implementing it effectively would address unemployment,” he alleges. The government’s plan to offer alternative crops for farmers in place of ganja is also not being implemented properly. The seeds and saplings of the alternative crops don’t reach farmers in interior hamlets; the supply is done only in mandal headquarters, he alleges.
According to the police, there are currently no ganja plantations in ASR district, with fields even in remote villages having been destroyed. The police say the ganja being seized now originates from certain areas of Odisha.
ASR district is reportedly being used mainly as a transit route before the contraband moves on to Visakhapatnam and then to other States. Officials also emphasise that in recent years, the police have relied heavily on a series of community welfare programmes and developmental initiatives designed to prevent tribal youth from turning towards Maoism or ganja smuggling, while also discouraging farmers from cultivating ganja.
These programmes are centred on trust-building, confidence enhancement and expanding employment opportunities. Initiatives such as ‘Saral’ and ‘Prerana’ for career guidance and employment and ‘Nirman’ for personal and professional development are being implemented with a special focus on young people.
ASR district Superintendent of Police Amit Bardar recently explained that under ‘Prerana’, employment melas were conducted at Araku, Paderu, Chintapalli, Rampachodavaram and other locations, where a significant number of youth secured jobs. In partnership with the AP State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC), several skill development programmes are being organised.
As part of the ‘Nirman’ initiative, police officials are exposing tribal students to new avenues of personal and professional growth. Study tours to industrial units, IT firms and tourist hubs in metropolitan cities are being organised for young tribal graduates to give them direct exposure to professional environments and emerging career possibilities. He also noted the remarkable talent among tribal youth in volleyball, which the police were encouraging through tournaments conducted across various mandals.
What Home Minister says
During her inspection of the Visakhapatnam Central Jail, Home Minister V. Anitha said she was moved by the plight of the tribespeople who were used as “scapegoats” in several ganja-related cases. She said the matter would be taken up for discussion.
