The Bangalore Solid Waste Management Limited (BSWML) said on Thursday that the city’s waste segregation has improved to 55% following a series of measures undertaken to streamline the handling of solid waste in the city limits. The agency has requested households to segregate waste into wet, dry, and household hazardous sanitary categories, and has started awareness campaigns across all wards.
As part of the initiative, two workers have been deployed in each ward to educate residents on the importance of segregation. The agency is also conducting Information, Education and Communication (IEC) programmes and has assigned dedicated primary collection vehicles to separately collect wet and dry waste. Officials said fines are being levied on households and establishments that fail to segregate waste or dump trash.
According to BSWML, the improved segregation has helped reduce the burden on landfills. Since October 14, the agency has been sending low-value plastic from legacy waste to a power generation unit. Initially, 18 MT of such plastic was transported daily, this has now increased to 300–350 MT transported in 60–70 compactors.
In October, the city disposed of 11.99 lakh MT of low-value plastic, and the figure rose to 67.26 lakh MT in November, officials said.
