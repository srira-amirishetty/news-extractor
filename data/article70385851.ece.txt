The Bengaluru police have arrested a 28-year-old man for allegedly molesting, threatening, and assaulting a woman after barging into her hotel in southeast Bengaluru’s Parappana Agrahara.
The accused has been identified as Hrithik Reddy, a landlord from Shantipura near Parappana Agrahara. The woman, 37, runs a hotel with her husband by the Shantipura Main Road, where the incident occurred.
The incident unfolded on Tuesday around 7 p.m. Reddy was involved in a verbal altercation with another motorist after their two-wheelers were involved in a minor accident. The spat escalated, and both men began fighting on the Shantipura main road. In the melee, they entered the hotel operated by the woman and created a ruckus inside the eatery.
“The woman asked them to go out and fight, but they continued. When she insisted and raised her voice, Reddy pushed and assaulted her,” a police officer told The Hindu. Reddy allegedly molested the woman when she screamed at them.
The officer also noted that the accused threw out the sambar and other food items kept in the hotel. He also shuttered the eatery and threatened the woman, saying he would ensure she could no longer run the hotel in the area.
Following a complaint filed by the woman the next day, the Parappana Agrahara police arrested the accused.
