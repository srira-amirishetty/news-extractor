The Chittoor district administration has launched coordinated efforts with Alluri Sitarama Raju (ASR) district authorities after several passengers from Chittoor and surrounding areas were among the victims of Friday’s (December 12, 2025) fatal bus accident at Raju Gari Metta near Maredumilli on the Araku–Bhadrachalam route.
The Vigneswara Travels bus (AP 39 UM 6543), which left Chittoor four days ago from the Nagaiah Kalakshetram junction, was carrying 37 passengers when it plunged into a gorge. While the ASR district police have already reported nine deaths and 22 injuries, officials confirmed that a significant number of the victims were residents of Chittoor district.
Chittoor District Collector Sumit Kumar said he immediately contacted the ASR district administration to gather verified information on passengers from Chittoor and ensure that families receive timely updates. He said arrangements have been made for the treatment of the injured at Chinturu Area Hospital, and liaison teams have been tasked with assisting relatives travelling to ASR district.
On the Collector’s instructions, Transport Department and police officials visited the local Vigneswara Travels office at the Bhajana Gudi street in Chittoor to retrieve passenger details and verify them to establish the exact number of Chittoor residents on board.
