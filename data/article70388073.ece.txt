A youth lost his life in a late-night road collision at Magadi in Bengaluru South district on December 11 allegedly involving a vehicle registered under the name of Shashank Revanna, son of former Minister H. M. Revanna.
The fatal crash occurred at approximately 10.30 p.m. near the Gudemaranahalli toll booth in Magadi, in the Bengaluru South district. The victim, identified as Rajesh, 27, hailed from Belagumba village in Magadi taluk.
Police from Kuduru station, who have registered a case, said Rajesh worked in a private firm in Bengaluru. He was heading home on his scooter when the vehicle was struck by an SUV travelling from Magadi towards Bengaluru. Officers stated that the impact left Rajesh with grievous injuries, and he succumbed at the spot.
