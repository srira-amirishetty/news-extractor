Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Ambadas Danve on Thursday (December 12, 2025) called Devendra Fadnavis a “miser Chief Minister” over the relief package given to farmers from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. However, the CMO called the information “incorrect, clarifying that so far ₹61.5 crore of assistance have been distributed from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund during the period of October, November, and December.
On Thursday (December 12, 2025), Mr. Danve posted an official document on X in which he mentioned, “Only ₹75,000 was spent from CM’s Relief Fund for flood-affected farmers in October, when the fund received was ₹106. 57 crore in October alone.”
In response, the CMO said, “The information is wrong, and an inquiry is under way on why the wrong information was provided.”
The reply post on X mentioned, “Giving the figures for October alone creates misunderstandings. During October, November and December, the fund collected was ₹61.51crore.”
The CMO also clarified that the amount from the CM‘s Relief Fund is utilised on a daily basis. So it is wrong to draw conclusions based on information for just one month. Besides, along with the fund, the farmers are receiving assistance from other departments, including the Relief and Rehabilitation Department.
“Over ₹14,000 crore from the special package of ₹32,000 crore have been directly deposited into farmers’ accounts,” as per the post.
In September, several regions in Maharashtra were severely affected owing to heavy rainfall and crops on 68.69 lakh hectares were damaged in the State. To provide relief to the farmers, the Maharashtra government announced a package of ₹31,628 crore.
‘Supplementary demands’
On Thursday (December 12, 2025), the issues of farmers were discussed along with the damage suffered by farmers owing to heavy rain. Shiv Sena (UBT) group leader Bhaskar Jadhav lashed out at the Mahayuti Ministers as they were not present in the proceedings, saying, “Is there any seriousness among the leaders? Cotton, oranges, and onions have been destroyed. The cotton MSP has been below ₹7,200 for the last four to five years; Soyabean has been around ₹3,200; the inflation rate has been at an all-time high. Somehow, farmers were surviving, then the disaster hit them.”
In the Assembly, the Government was urged to explain how the ₹3,200 crores package will strengthen the farmers, bring their animals into the shed, how the milk business will return to normal, and other issues. “The supplementary demands of more than ₹75,000 crore have been made. How will you provide help when the State’s financial situation is not in good shape?” Mr. Jadhav questioned.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar stated that the government has been seeking a ₹29,000 crore relief package from the Centre, clarifying that the detailed reports were sent to the Centre on November 27 and December 1, 2025. The Union Government sent an eight-member team for inspection to visit Dharashiv, Beed, Ahilyanagar, and Solapur districts from November 3 to 5, 2025.
In response to the question over the supplementary demands for two consecutive days, Mr. Pawar said, “The ₹15,000 crore has been given, under Baliraja Vija Sahuliya yojana — ₹9,000 crore to give additional, and ₹900 crore for the expanded Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana..... So far, ₹44,000 crore relief has been provided to farmers hit by unseasonal rainfall and flooding and ₹29,781 crore help is sought from the Central Government.”
