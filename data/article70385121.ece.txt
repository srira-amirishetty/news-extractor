The Building Workers Union (CIU), under the aegis of CITU Central City Committee, organised a motorbike rally in Vijayawada on Thursday to mobilise workers for the 18th All-India Maha Sabha, scheduled to be held from December 31, 2025 to January 4, 2026, in Visakhapatnam. The Maha Sabha will conclude with a massive public gathering and rally at RK Beach on January 4.
CIU central city secretary B. Govindu said that the union continues to fight for workers’ rights, welfare, and the protection of public sector industries. He criticised the Central government for merging 29 labour laws into four labour codes, calling it a step to suppress workers, and criticised the State and central policies as those affecting public sector units, including Visakhapatnam Steel Plant and the electricity distribution. Workers from Vijayawada’s construction sector were urged to participate actively.
Leaders highlighted the union’s support for workers during hardships, including natural calamities, and condemned the increase of work hours from 8 to 10 hours, particularly affecting women working in night shifts.
The campaign aims to unite construction workers across all sectors, raise awareness of labour rights, and ensure active participation in the nationwide Maha Sabha.
