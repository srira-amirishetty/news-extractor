A 35-year-old man was allegedly hacked to death on Thursday by his own brother at a madrasa in south Bengaluru’s Banashankari over a family dispute.
The deceased has been identified as Mohammad Muzahid, who used to run the madrasa in Yarabnagar near Banashankari. The accused, Mohammad Muzafar, 23, also suffered injuries during the altercation and was currently undergoing treatment.
Police said they would take him into custody after he was discharged.
The incident occurred around 5.30 a.m. at the madrasa. A fight allegedly broke out between the brothers following a discussion about Muzahid scolding their mother the previous day.
A police officer investigating the case told The Hindu that the accused lives with his parents in Bommanahalli. On Wednesday, the family had visited Muzahid’s house, who lived separately, during which a minor verbal spat took place among them.
“After dinner, the brothers went to the madrasa to sleep as there wasn’t enough space at the house. Early morning on Thursday, the brothers again picked a fight over the same issue,” the officer said.
The fight escalated, and one of them grabbed a knife in the heat of the moment. In the melee, both sustained injuries, while Muzafar allegedly stabbed his brother in the neck and chest, resulting in his death.
“After the fight, Muzafar stormed out of the madrasa, but collapsed due to his injuries. A neighbour saw him covered in blood and called the police helpline,” the officer told The Hindu.
The Banashankari police reached the spot and found Muzahid lying in a pool of blood and Muzafar on the ground in pain. Muzafar was shifted to a nearby hospital, while Muzahid’s body was sent for post-mortem. Muzafar told police that he killed his brother because he refused to apologise to their mother after the argument. However, the police have yet to conduct a full interrogation after his discharge.
An FIR has been registered at the Banashankari police station against Muzafar under BNS Section 103, which pertains to murder.
