The Kerala High Court (HC) has warned of initiating action against the temple advisory committee and the Devaswom officer if steps are not taken to ensure cleanliness on the Chottanikkara Bhagavathy Temple premises.
Hearing a plea filed by a Chottanikkara native, a Division Bench of Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan V. and Justice K.V. Jayakumar observed that the condition of the premises was a threat to public health and the environment.
The court also directed the executive director of Suchithwa Mission to depute two senior officials to do a cleanliness audit of the temple premises and suggest solutions.
Expressing concern at plastic waste and other garbage being strewn openly on the premises of the temple, the High Court had observed a fortnight ago that the measures adopted by the temple authorities were wholly inadequate. The court also expressed concern at there being no effective segregation of plastic and other waste.
