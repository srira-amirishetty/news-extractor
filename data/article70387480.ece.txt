A 70-foot iron statue of football icon Lionel Messi, claimed as the largest ever of the Argentine superstar, was completed by the Sree Bhumi Sporting Club at Lake Town in South Dum Dum, Kolkata.
The statue shows Messi holding the FIFA World Cup trophy, and final surface work is currently under way. Monty Paul’s team is carrying out the finishing touches, while the surrounding area is also being prepared.
West Bengal Minister and Sree Bhumi Sporting Club President Sujit Bose said the structure was completed in just forty days.
“This is a very big statue, 70 foot in height. There is no other statue of Messi this big in the world. Messi is coming to Kolkata, and there are a lot of fans of Messi,” he told ANI.
Referring to previous football legends who visited Kolkata, he said, “Before him, there were (Diego) Maradona, (Emiliano) Martinez, Ronaldinho (Gaucho) of Brazil, they all have come here. In Sreebhumi, everybody came.”
Built in 40 days
He added, “We built this statue in 40 days. Monty Paul made it ready. People were saying that we have a statue of Maradona, so why won’t there be one of Messi.”
Bose also said the timing felt significant ahead of the 2026 World Cup. “Messi will like this statue. Inauguration will be on the 13th virtually from Kolkata,” he said.
He confirmed that the structure would be fully completed within the next couple of days, saying, “It will be completed fully by the day after tomorrow.”
He then acknowledged the support of State authorities and added, “The Government has helped us a lot.”
According to Sree Bhumi organisers, Messi will inaugurate the statue virtually on December 13, as he will not be able to attend in person due to security and law-and-order concerns. They expressed hope that the large-scale tribute will be appreciated by football fans across West Bengal.
