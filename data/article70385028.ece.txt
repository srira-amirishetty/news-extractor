More than 2.5 lakh workers engaged in various establishments across Andhra Pradesh have been registered under the Scheme for Promotion of Registration of Employers and Employees (SPREE-2025) launched by Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) to expand social security coverge.
“The SPREE aims at enrolling the eligible workers in various establishments. About 2.5 lakh workers from 2,000 establishments have registered under SPREE. They are now eligible for various social security benefits,” ESIC State Regional Director Malla Rama Rao told The Hindu on Thursday.
