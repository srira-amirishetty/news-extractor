Home Minister G. Parameshwar has said that he would consider setting up one more police commissionerate in Bengaluru city after sending a team to the police administration in metropolitan cities where additional commissionerates have been set up.
The Minister was responding to Congress member K. Govindraju’s demand for one more police commissionerate for effective police administration in the Legislative Council in Belagavi on Thursday.
The Minister said additional commissionerates had been set up in the cities of Mumbai, New Delhi and Hyderabad. “As of now, I don’t think one more commissionerate is required for Bengaluru city. We have six joint commissioners and 11 DCPs, besides four DCPs for traffic and nine ACPs for cyber crimes. However, in the future, considering the growth of the city and its population, we may require setting up one more commissionerate to handle the city,” he stated.
Mr. Parameshwara said he would send a team of officials to Mumbai, New Delhi and Hyderabad to study if opening new commissionerates helped in ensuring effective law and order maintenance. “We will consider opening one more commissionerate after studying what has happened in other metropolitan cities,” he said.
Earlier, Mr. Govindaraju, arguing for the additional commissionerate, stated that the commissionerate was set up in Bengaluru in 1964 with a DIG-rank officer as commissioner and two DCPs. The commissionerate was upgraded later in 1990 and 2010. “Considering the present population of the city and the number of crimes, the city needs two commissioners,” he commented.
